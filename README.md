# 3D Animation & Modeling Projects

## About the Projects
My love for modeling and animation, combined with my hobby of exploring new technologies, resulted in the development of multiple 3D models stored in this repository. These projects were created using **Blender** and integrated into **Unity** for visualization and interactive experiences.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Modeling & Animation:** Blender  
- **Game Engine Integration:** Unity  
- **Texturing & Rendering:** Blender Cycles, Eevee  
- **File Formats:** `.blend`, `.blend1`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.mp4`

## Projects Highlights

### **Object & Prop Modeling**
- Modeled a **Ben 10 Omnitrix watch**, focusing on accuracy in shape and detailing.  
- Created a **realistic hammer** with textured surfaces to enhance material appearance.
